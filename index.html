                    <p class="bulkP">I like cats, computers, and games. There is not much more to me than that. Before
                        choosing Computer Science as my career path I wanted to become a Science Teacher. I realized
                        pretty quickly that Science was not my thing like I thought it to be, and at this point, I knew
                        I was interested in computers and how they work but I was scared to get into the field.
                        Ultimately I decided to start learning and I got discouraged a lot of the time but I kept
                        pushing it because I started becoming passionate about the work I was doing
                        and I'm glad that I stuck with it. That's all thereis about me!
                        thanks for reading :)</p>
